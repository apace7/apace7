## Hi there 👋, I’m Andrew Pace (@apace7)

I’m a Galaxy Evolution and Cosmology (GECO) Fellow at the University of Virginia in the Department of Astronomy. My research focuses on near-field cosmology to understand dark matter and galaxy formation. I study the structure and kinematics of Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies, star clusters, and stellar streams.
